# HotelServiceApp
Java SE project for the subject "Laboratorio III" at the National Technological University of Mar del Plata

In this project we will develop a hotel service prototype.
We want to achieve the base functionality that was described in class and add the maximum effort to improve our skills over the programming language studied this year "Java SE", and use them to develop our best project.
We are also researching for information to implement a GUI using JavaFx
